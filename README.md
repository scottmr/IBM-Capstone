Restaurant location

1.	A description of the problem and a discussion of the background.

I’ll be focusing on the Big Apple (NYC) in looking for a place to open a restaurant. Specifically, I’ll be looking at what are arguably the two hottest areas for real estate at the moment

1) the recently completed Hudson Yard’s complex. A 25-acre area that is residential/ business mix. The focus here is because of the top name businesses it has attracted, its location directly above the Hudson Yards train stop, and it’s across the street from the Javits Convention Center. This means it has a tremendous amount of foot traffic available. Both local and tourists. 

2) The area known as ‘Billionaires Row’, several high-profile residential buildings are near completion on 57th St. And Nordstrom’s has recently opened up a store at the west-end of the development project. People with ludicrous amounts of money will be moving into this area. Also, it’s proximity to Central Park is a bonus which is a haven for locals and a major tourist attraction.

2.	A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.

The data I’ll be using will be from two sources. One is a free data source from NYU Spatial Data Repository -https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572. The other will be data from Foursquare. The foursquare data will be used to obtain the location of Carnegie Hall-which sits smack dab in the middle of Billionaires Row-as that area really isn’t a neighborhood per se. Also, I’ll be using their restaurant ratings to see if there are types of cuisine with less than favorable ratings that one could capitalize on. Or to also see which types of food might have no representation in those two areas.
